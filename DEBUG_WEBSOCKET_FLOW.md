# WebSocket/SSE Message Flow Debugging Guide

## Quick Start: Disable Prisma Logs

Add this to your `.env.local` to clean up the console:

```env
ENABLE_PRISMA_LOGS=false
```

This will disable the noisy Prisma query logs while keeping error logs visible.

## Message Flow Overview

When you send a message, here's what SHOULD happen:

```
1. User sends message via UI
   ‚Üì
2. Message created in database
   ‚Üì
3. messageEvents.emitMessageCreated() fires
   ‚Üì
4. DM Listener picks it up and auto-responds
   ‚Üì
5. Auto-response message created in database
   ‚Üì
6. messageEvents.emitMessageCreated() fires again
   ‚Üì
7. broadcastMessageToDM() broadcasts to all SSE subscribers
   ‚Üì
8. SSE callback invokes, sending message to frontend
   ‚Üì
9. Frontend receives via EventSource and displays
```

## Log Markers to Track

### Phase 1: User Message Sent

Look for these logs in order:

```
üì® MESSAGE SERVICE: Message created in DB
Content: [your message]
DM ID: cmgsae4420006ryb90isr56oe  ‚Üê NOTE THIS DM ID

üîä EVENT EMITTER: emitMessageCreated called
üîä Emitting DM_MESSAGE_CREATED event...

üîî DM LISTENER EVENT TRIGGERED
‚úÖ MESSAGE IS FROM USER - WILL RESPOND

üì° ABOUT TO BROADCAST TO DM CLIENTS
From user: YES

[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST] ‚úÖ BROADCASTING TO 1 SUBSCRIBER(S)
[SSE MESSAGE] ‚úÖ Successfully sent to client
```

### Phase 2: Auto-Response Sent (The Critical Part)

```
üì® MESSAGE SERVICE: Message created in DB
Content: Hi I'm [Persona]
DM ID: cmgsae4420006ryb90isr56oe  ‚Üê MUST BE SAME ID

üîä EVENT EMITTER: emitMessageCreated called
üîä Emitting DM_MESSAGE_CREATED event...

üîî DM LISTENER EVENT TRIGGERED
‚è≠Ô∏è  SKIPPING: Message is from persona, not user  ‚Üê Expected skip

üì° ABOUT TO BROADCAST TO DM CLIENTS
From persona: YES

[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST] Subscription State BEFORE Broadcast:
Active callbacks: ???  ‚Üê THIS IS THE KEY NUMBER
```

---

## The Bug: Where Subscribers Disappear

**In Phase 1**, you should see:
```
[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST] Active callbacks: 1
```

**In Phase 2**, if the bug happens, you'll see:
```
[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST] Active callbacks: 0
```

### What to Look for Between Phase 1 and Phase 2

Between these two broadcasts, check for:

1. **[WEBSOCKET UNSUBSCRIBE]** - If you see this, the subscription was removed
2. **[SSE DISCONNECT]** - If you see this, the client connection closed
3. **[SSE MESSAGE] ‚ùå Error** - If errors occurred while sending Phase 1 message
4. **No logs at all** - The timing might be off, or messages are being queued

---

## Log Format Key

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[WEBSOCKET SUBSCRIBE]` | A new SSE client subscribed | Adding callback for DM |
| `[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST]` | Broadcasting a message to DM | Message being sent to subscribers |
| `[WEBSOCKET UNSUBSCRIBE]` | An SSE client unsubscribed | Client disconnected |
| `[SSE CONNECTION]` | SSE connection lifecycle | Client connected/ready |
| `[SSE MESSAGE]` | Message delivery to client | Enqueuing message to controller |
| `[SSE DISCONNECT]` | Client cleanup | Connection closed |

---

## How to Debug

### Step 1: Enable Detailed Logging
Make sure `ENABLE_PRISMA_LOGS=false` is set so Prisma logs don't clutter the output.

### Step 2: Send a Test Message
1. Open the browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for: `[useWebSocket] Message received: [ID]`
4. Should show TWICE (once for user message, once for auto-response)

### Step 3: Check Backend Console
Look for all the phases above. Pay special attention to:

- **Phase 1, Phase 2 DM IDs match?** If they don't, the broadcast goes to wrong DM
- **Active callbacks count?** Should be 1 in Phase 1 and Phase 2
- **Any disconnect logs between phases?**

### Step 4: Trace the Subscription

If Phase 2 shows `Active callbacks: 0`, look backward in logs for:

```
[WEBSOCKET UNSUBSCRIBE] ‚úÖ Subscription removed
```

This tells you WHEN the subscription was removed. Check what happened before it.

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Active callbacks: 0" in Phase 2

**Possible Causes:**
1. SSE connection closed between Phase 1 and Phase 2
2. Client disconnected while listener was running
3. The subscription was explicitly removed
4. Browser tab became inactive/backgrounded

**What to check:**
- Look for `[SSE DISCONNECT]` logs
- Check browser DevTools - is the SSE connection open?
- Check if browser tab is still focused

### Issue: Message queued but not delivered

From logs:
```
[WEBSOCKET BROADCAST] Message will be available in queue for new subscribers
```

This means:
- Message WAS created and emitted
- Message WAS added to queue
- But NO subscribers to send it to
- New subscribers MIGHT get it later

---

## Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:

```env
# Enable/disable Prisma query logging (very verbose)
ENABLE_PRISMA_LOGS=false
```

To enable Prisma logs:
```env
ENABLE_PRISMA_LOGS=true
```

---

## Next Steps

Once you identify WHERE the subscribers disappear, we can:
1. Add more targeted logging
2. Identify if it's a timing issue
3. Fix the root cause
4. Ensure both messages arrive consistently
