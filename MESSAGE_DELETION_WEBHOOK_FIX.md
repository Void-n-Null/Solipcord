# Message Deletion Webhook Fix

## Problem
Message creation was using WebSocket webhooks for real-time updates in the UI, but message deletion did not hook into that system. When a message was deleted, the UI would not update automatically - only refreshing the page would show the deletion.

## Solution
Integrated message deletion events into the existing WebSocket/broadcast system to achieve real-time deletion updates.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Message Service (`src/services/message.service.ts`)**
- Added WebSocket broadcasting in the `deleteMessage()` method
- When a message is deleted, it now broadcasts a deletion event object through the same channel as message creation:
  ```typescript
  {
    type: 'message_deleted',
    messageId: id,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
  ```
- This works for both DM and Group messages

#### 2. **WebSocket Hook (`src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)**
- Added new `onMessageDeleted` callback option to the `UseWebSocketOptions` interface
- Updated the message event listener to check if incoming data is a deletion event (`data.type === 'message_deleted'`)
- Routes deletion events to `onMessageDeleted` callback and regular messages to `onMessageReceived` callback
- The hook now distinguishes between:
  - **Regular message objects** (for creation): passed to `onMessageReceived`
  - **Deletion events** (with `type: 'message_deleted'`): passed to `onMessageDeleted`

#### 3. **Content Area (`src/components/ContentArea.tsx`)**
- Added `handleWebSocketMessageDeleted` callback that filters deleted messages from state
- Passed this callback to `useWebSocket` hook via `onMessageDeleted` prop
- Messages are now instantly removed from the UI when deleted through the WebSocket stream

### How It Works

1. User deletes a message via the UI (`handleDeleteMessage` in `DMChatInterface`)
2. DELETE request is sent to `/api/messages/[messageId]`
3. Message service processes the deletion:
   - Fetches message details
   - Deletes from database
   - Emits internal event (for DM listeners)
   - **Broadcasts deletion event through WebSocket** ← NEW
4. SSE endpoint receives the deletion event and streams it to all connected clients
5. `useWebSocket` hook detects the `type: 'message_deleted'` field
6. Calls `onMessageDeleted` callback in `ContentArea`
7. `ContentArea` filters the deleted message from state
8. UI instantly reflects the deletion

### Benefits
- ✅ Real-time message deletion updates across all open clients
- ✅ Consistent with existing message creation webhook pattern
- ✅ No duplicate logic - uses same broadcast system
- ✅ Works for both DMs and Groups
- ✅ Maintains single source of truth through WebSocket

### Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open a DM conversation
2. Send a message (verify it appears)
3. Delete the message
4. Observe the message instantly disappears from the UI (no page refresh needed)
5. If you have multiple windows open to the same DM, all will see the deletion in real-time
